### Conclusion
The task was to make a web forum using Java and since I had no experience with connecting a database in Java (only using PHP), I decided to try working with Spring for very first time. 
While working on this project I encountered a lot of problems, from non-functional dependencies, to incorrect accesses, to frustration why code works once and not the other time. At least now I know that I have to work on myself to be able to design, create and implement a backend and frontend page in Java Spring
